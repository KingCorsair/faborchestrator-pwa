 * Added to FabOrchestrator's own documents by the gateway
 * (`lib/gateway/html-inject.ts`). It contributes two things, neither of them
 * visible:
 *
 *   · the single-sign-out watcher, which ends this app's session when
 *     FabOrchestrator ends its own
 *   · the PWA service-worker registration
 *
 * ── It adds no navigation (11 September) ────────────────────────────────────
 * From WP6 until 11 September this file also injected navigation — a floating
 * hamburger, then a Back arrow, then both — because below 768px
 * FabOrchestrator hid its sidebar in a closed drawer with nothing on screen to
 * open it, and hid its header's links with nothing in their place. That was
 * FabOrchestrator's responsive defect, and it is now fixed in FabOrchestrator
 * itself: a slim bar holding its own `SidebarTrigger` on the chat and modeling
 * pages, and a menu button in its own header on the cockpit and Reports. So the
 * controls, the keyboard-shortcut driver and the corner-measuring logic are
 * gone, and this app keeps no navigation of its own. The history is in
 * `docs/STATUS.md`.

  /* ── Single sign-OUT, the other half of the WP2 bridge ──────────────────
   *
   * WP2 made one sign-in serve both applications: this app's form obtains
   * FabOrchestrator's token, keeps it in an httpOnly cookie, and injects it on
   * every forwarded call. Nothing did the reverse. When **FabOrchestrator**
   * decided the session was over, this app went on holding a cookie for a
   * session that no longer existed.
   *
   * That is a redirect loop, not just untidiness. FabOrchestrator's guards
   * navigate to `/` meaning "go to our login page"; on this origin `/` is the
   * front door and sends a signed-in operator to `/home`; FabOrchestrator's
   * guard runs again. Round and round.
   *
   * `expiredUpstream()` in the gateway already clears the cookie on any upstream
   * 401, which covers every case where FabOrchestrator is *asked* something. It
   * cannot cover the one that matters most here: **FabOrchestrator's idle timer
   * clears its own storage after 30 minutes without making a request at all**,
   * so no 401 is ever produced and the cookie outlives the session in silence.
   *
   * This closes it at the only place both facts are visible — inside a
   * FabOrchestrator document, where its token either is or is not in
   * localStorage. If it is gone, this app's session is over too, and the
   * operator belongs at the sign-in form rather than in a loop.
   *
   * The loop's midpoint is always a FabOrchestrator document, which is exactly
   * where this runs — so it is broken on the first pass rather than bounded by
   * a counter.

   * This app registers `/sw.js` from `components/register-sw.tsx`, which is

   * else an operator normally goes. In practice that is enough, because the
   * session gate makes every signed-out visitor pass through `/login` first,
   * and the registration's scope is `/`, so the worker it leaves behind
   * controls FabOrchestrator's pages afterwards. Measured on the deployment:
   * active, scope `/`, and controlling `/home`, `/chat` and `/reports`.
   *
   * "In practice" is doing work in that sentence, though. An operator who is
   * already signed in and opens `/home` directly — a shared link, a home-screen
   * shortcut, a restored tab — never touches `/login`, and if their site data
   * was cleared in the meantime there is no worker and nothing to register it.
   * They would get a working app with no offline page and no installability
   * until they happened to sign out.
   *
   * So the registration is repeated here, where it runs on every
   * FabOrchestrator document. `register()` on an already-registered scope is
   * a no-op that resolves to the existing registration, so the normal path
   * costs nothing.
